## 📌 Project Title
**Android Quiz Application**



## 📖 Project Description

The **Android Quiz Application** is a mobile-based quiz system developed as a **BCA Minor Project**. The application allows users to participate in a time-bound quiz by entering basic details such as **name**, **course**, and **language preference (Hindi or English)**.

Access to the quiz is controlled using a fixed **quiz code**, ensuring authorized participation only. Quiz questions are stored locally within the Java files, while user details, quiz scores, and leaderboard information are stored using **Firebase Firestore**.

The application automatically evaluates user responses, displays the final score, and shows a leaderboard ranking participants based on their performance. This project demonstrates fundamental Android development concepts such as activity navigation, XML-based UI design, Java programming, and cloud database integration.
